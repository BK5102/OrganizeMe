# OrganizeMe 
   Powerful tool that helps high school and college students to efficiently manage their assignments, projects and tasks. 
   
## Description
   Personally, I've always found it difficult to keep track of all the assignments, projects and tasks I have to complete by a certain date. This led me to develop a web application aimed to solve just that problem. Thus, through this web application, students can create an account, log in tasks, and assignments with due dates corresponding to their course. Everytthing is all in spot, so students can stay better organized and on top of their schedules. Additionally, email notifications will act as a reminder altering them when assignments are coming up.
